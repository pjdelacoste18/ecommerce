Situation: A new supplier has recently been added to the Sheesh-lingan supplier list, and their product inventory must be entered into the system database.

Solution using Insert:

To add the new supplier and their products to the database, the INSERT statement can be used.                                                                                                                                             INSERT INTO suppliers (supplier_name, supplier_address, supplier_contact)
VALUES ('New Supplier', '420 Main Street', '123-4444');

INSERT INTO products (product_name, supplier_id, price, quantity)
VALUES ('Pork', LAST_INSERT_ID(), 20,000, 50),
('Beef', LAST_INSERT_ID(), 25,000, 50);
