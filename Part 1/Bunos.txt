Situation: A user has accidentally deleted some important data from their account.

Solution: You can create a display that allows users to restore deleted data. The display should ask users to select the data they want to restore and provide a list of available backups. Once the user selects the backup they want to restore, the system should restore the data and display a message to the user confirming the action.                                                                                                        SELECT * FROM deleted_data WHERE user_id = [user_id] ORDER BY deleted_date DESC;                 Once the user selects the data they want to restore, you can use an INSERT statement to insert the data back into the database                                                                                                            INSERT INTO user_data (user_id, data) VALUES ([user_id], [restored_data]);
